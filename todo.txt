## Worlds
addFocus(Entity) on the worlds - allow worlds to follow players (side scrollers etc)
setCenter on worlds - pin the world to a position
add world rendering (smart)
add example code of getting entities in tile components
add predefined components for tiles (TileCollider)

## General
implement TiledWorld collisions (see TileCollider)
Possibly add a Prefab manager? allows instantiating copies of entities
Instantiate method - in the Scene - takes existing entity - prefab manager

REMEMBER

CustomComponent clone doesn't copy variables
