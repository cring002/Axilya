# Axilya v0.7.1

A basic 2D game framework written in C++, runnable with Make. To see the initial production of this project see: https://github.com/vexparadox/axInitial

Please see the WIKI on how to use this framework. It's not very scary once you get started.

See https://github.com/vexparadox/AXServer for the server module of Axilya. This is still in early development.

`NFI` = Not fully implemented

Versions jump around because I haven't been able to consistently work on features!
